				<div class="left">
					<p>Since September 2017 I've been working with the great people at Forza Football. Throughout the years I've been involved in a lot of different organisations and events, but in the spring of 2018 I decided to dedicate all my focus to Forza. Since then I've spent part of my time as a Product Owner and part of my time in the Data Science team, mainly on data analytics.</p>
					<p>I've come to learn that great and high-performing teams are created from trust, and trust comes from showing vulnerability.</p>
					<p>Also, I love sports... Frölunda FC, BK Häcken, Tottenham Hotspurs &amp; Oakland Raiders are the teams I acively cheer for and watch, but I watch almost any sport with big joy.</p>

						<h4>Cover every football match</h4>
						<p>At Forza Football we build a live score application for football. Our goal is to become the best app out there by covering every football match in the world. On top of that we fight against inequalities, racism, homophobia, and corruption within the sport in different ways.</p>

						<p>Vnu provide venues, such as nightclubs, with hardware which enable them to capture exactly when the guests arrive and leave. This enable them to view, compare, and analyze their guestflow, both in real time and historically. No more guesswork required when staffing, analyzing marketing or event organizers results.<br/><br/>We put Vnu down in June 2017.</p>

It is basically your travel assistant when</p>

						<h4>A week dedicated to #gbgtech</h4>
						<p>Every year during a week in May we gather different events in order to open up the tech and startup community of Gothenburg - #gbgtech, to the public. Hackathons, seminars, networking and some startup competitions together become the content of #gbgtechWeek, which me and my friend Linus Olsson founded in 2015. We gather more than 2 500 visitors and 15 events, and has become one of Gothenburg's most important tech and startup events during the whole year!</p>

						<h4>Hackathon on a boat</h4>
						<p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is one of Scanidinavias most prestigeful hackathons and was founded in 2014, and in 2015 I was asked to join the team to arrange it. It was one of the events during #gbgtechWeek and we went a bit crazy and arranged it on a boat which went around in Gotheburgs archipelago during the day. Partners to the hack was Spotify, Burt, Recorded Future, Giphy, Google and several other companies.</p>

						<h4>B.Sc. Software Engineering</h4>
						<p>Between 2011 and 2014 I finished my bachelor at Chalmers University of Technology. This programme mainly focused on Java development through many different group projects. This ment that we developed both programming skills, project management skills and how to perform an agile software development project. <br /><br />During this time I was also involved in the Student Union in different way. Between 2013 and 2014 I was Chairman of the Software Engineering Student Division.</p>

						<h4>M.Sc. Entrepreneurship & Business Design</h4>

This master programme is also know as Chalmers School of Entrepreneurship and focus on teaching the different aspects of entrepreneurship.
