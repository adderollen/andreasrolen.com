						<h4>New Android Application</h4>
						<p>During my summer internship at BEKK Consulting in Oslo, Norway, I helped Norwegian Airshuttle AS to redo their Android application with their new brand. The app is used to hanndle your mobile ticket, boarding pass, help you to book new tickets, checkin to your flight, search for flight arrival and departure times and adding existing travels to your account. It is basically your travel assistant when</p>

						<h4>A week dedicated to #gbgtech</h4>
						<p>During about a week we gathered 17 different events in order to open up the tech and startup community of Gothenburg - #gbgtech, to the public. Hackathons, seminars, networking and some startup competitions created the content of #gbgtechWeek, which me and my friend Linus Olsson founded. The week was visited by more than 2 500 people and hopefully we will arrange this again 2016!</p>

						<h4>Hackathon on a boat</h4>
						<p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is one of Scanidinavias most prestigeful hackathons and was founded in 2014, and in 2015 I was asked to join the team to arrange it. It was one of the events during #gbgtechWeek and we went a bit crazy and arranged it on a boat which went around in Gotheburgs archipelago during the day. Partners to the hack was Spotify, Burt, Recorded Future, Giphy, Google and several other companies.</p>

						<h4>B.Sc. Software Engineering</h4>
						<p>Between 2011 and 2014 I finished my bachelor at Chalmers University of Technology. This programme mainly focused on Java development through many different group projects. This ment that we developed both programming skills, project management skills and how to perform an agile software development project. <br /><br />During this time I was also involved in the Student Union in different way. Between 2013 and 2014 I was Chairman of the Software Engineering Student Division.</p>
