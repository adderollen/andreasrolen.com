				<div class="left">
					<p>I love solving end user problems together with a group of highly skilled people. Over the years I've been fortunate to work closely with some of the most fantastic people. Right now I get the opportunity to do so within the Facebook organisation, focusing on solving the everyday problems for users and companies advertising on the platform.</p>
					<p>I've come to learn that great and high-performing teams are created from trust, and trust comes from showing vulnerability. If more product managers focused on building a strong culture in their teams, I believe teams would become more impactful and less people would burn out.</p>
					<p>Also, I love sports... Frölunda FC, BK Häcken, Tottenham Hotspurs &amp; Las Vegas Raiders are the teams I acively cheer for and watch, but I watch almost any sport with big joy.</p>

						<h4>Most valuable marketing partner to every business in the world</h4>
						<p>My focus at Facebook is supporting advertisers in their everyday work. Our team provide the Ads Manager App, a tool primarily for full-time advertisers to keep track and optimise their campaigns on the go.</p>

						<h4>Cover every football match</h4>
						<p>At Forza Football I was part of building a live score application for football. Our goal is to become the best app out there by covering every football match in the world. On top of that we fought against inequalities, racism, homophobia, and corruption within the sport in different ways.</p>

						<h4>Hardware enabled guestflow analytics</h4>
						<p>Vnu provided venues, such as nightclubs, with hardware which enabled them to capture exactly when the guests arrived and left. This enabled them to view, compare, and analyze their guestflow, both in real time and historically. No more guesswork required when staffing, analyzing marketing or event organizers results.<br/><br/>We put Vnu down in June 2017.</p>

						<h4>New Android Application</h4>
						<p>During my summer internship at BEKK Consulting in Oslo, Norway, I helped Norwegian Airshuttle AS to refresh their Android application with their new brand. The app is used to handle your mobile ticket, boarding pass, help you to book new tickets, checkin to your flight, search for flight arrival and departure times and adding existing travels to your account. It is basically your travel assistant when on the go.</p>

						<h4>A week dedicated to #gbgtech</h4>
						<p>Every year during a week in May we gathered different events in order to open up the tech and startup community of Gothenburg - #gbgtech, to the public. Hackathons, seminars, networking and some startup competitions together became the content of #gbgtechweek. Me and my friend Linus Olsson founded it in 2015, and were early on joined by Malin Kjällström who now drives this initiative. During my years we gathered around 2,500 visitors and 25 events every year.!</p>

						<h4>Hackathon on a boat</h4>
						<p>Gothenburg Startup Hack is one of Scanidinavias most prestigeful hackathons and was founded in 2014. In 2015 I was asked to join the team to organise it. It was one of the events during #gbgtechweek and we went a bit crazy and organised it on a boat, travelling around in Gotheburgs archipelago during the day. Partners to the hack was Spotify, Burt, Recorded Future, Giphy, Google and several other companies.</p>

						<h4>E-sport tournament in Sweden</h4>
						<p>Together with one of Sweden's largest youth organizations, Sverok, in my role as Competition Manager we organised one of Sweden's largest e-sport tournaments. With a prizepool of 800 000SEK and some of the best teams in the world we created a great tournament which Swedish Television Channel 4 broadcasted live. The CS:GO tournament were the highlight featuring some of the best players in the world.</p>

						<h4>B.Sc. Software Engineering</h4>
						<p>Between 2011 and 2014 I finished my bachelor at Chalmers University of Technology. This programme mainly focused on Java development through many different group projects. This meant that we developed both programming skills, project management skills and how to perform an agile software development project. <br /><br />During this time I was also involved in the Student Union in different way. Between 2013 and 2014 I was Chairman of the Software Engineering Student Division.</p>

						<h4>M.Sc. Entrepreneurship & Business Design</h4>
						<p>After my studies at Software Engineering, I took the decision to pick a master within business development. This master programme is know as Chalmers School of Entrepreneurship and focus on teaching the different aspects of entrepreneurship. During the second year you run your own startup in Chalmers Ventures incubator, which also was our master thesis project. <br /><br />This was the place where Vnu were founded. I graduated in 2016.</p>
